What is AbstractUser?
AbstractUser is like a blueprint or template for creating custom user models in Django.

Django comes with a built-in system for handling users (like signing up, logging in, etc.), and by default, it uses a basic user model with fields like username, password, email, etc.

But what if you want to add extra fields to your users, like date_of_birth, profile_picture, or phone_number? Thatâ€™s where AbstractUser comes in!
